# Organization of the Course 

### Timetable {-}

Monday afternoon is computational statistics afternoon. In each of our sessions, we'll have both theory and practice sessions and a couple of breaks in between. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("kableExtra"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("tidyverse"))

timetable <- tibble("Day"=c("Monday"),
                    "Time (Theory 1)"=c("14:15-15:00"),
                    "Time (Theory 2)"=c("15:15-16:00"),
                    "Time (Theory 3)"=c("16:15-16:45"),
                    "Time (Practice)"=c("17:00-17:45"),
                    "Lecture Hall"   =c("Jur / HÃ¶rsaal K"))
           
timetable %>% kbl() %>%  kable_styling()
